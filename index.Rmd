# Questions

There exists uncertainty in travel demand models. This is known by transportation planners but the majority do not use any particular method to quantify it. This uncertainty exists to some extent by the variance among input parameters. A coefficient of variation can be used to approximate the standard deviation of the inputs, which then provides a range of values that are possible for model input [@zhao2002propagation]. A sampling method can then be used to determine the possible combinations of parameter variance. Two popular sampling methods are Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). MC simulation is capable of providing full variance probability, but requires large computations to be effective on a large scale model. LHS reduces the amount of variants needed, but the amount of reduction is unknown. [@yang2013sensitivity]

The research questions are therefore:

  - Using a dummy travel demand model, can Latin Hypercube Sampling simplify the iterations needed to approximate random sampling methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation)?
  - Does this method of sampling have few enough iterations for statewide model application?
