This is known by transportation planners but the majority do not use any particular method to quantify it. This uncertainty exists mostly due to the variance among input parameters. A coefficient of variation can be used to approximate the standard deviation of the inputs, which then provides a range of values that are possible for model input (Zhao and Kockelman 2002). A sampling method can then be used to determine the possible combinations of parameter variance. Two popular sampling methods are Monte Carlo simulation and Latin Hypercube sampling. Monte Carlo simulation is capable of providing full variance probability, but requires large computations to be effective on a large scale model (Yang et al. 2013). Latin Hypercube sampling reduces the amount variants needed, but the question arises on if the same result be achieved with fewer samples, and how many samples is that? The research questions are therefore: How many iterations of Latin Hypercube Sampling in a travel demand model are necessary to approximate random sampling methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation)? Does this method of sampling have few enough iterations for statewide model application?

The inputs for sampling that will be used are mode choice coefficients, mode choice constants, and destination choice parameters. These inputs are shown in Table 2.1, and Table 2.2. Table 2.1: Mode Choice Coefficients Name HBW HBO NHB CIVTT -0.0450 -0.0350 -0.0400 CCOST -0.0016 -0.0016 -0.0016 CWALK1 -0.0900 -0.0700 -0.0800 AUTOCOST 18.3000 18.3000 18.3000 Table 2.2: Mode Choice Constants Name HBW HBO NHB K_TRN -0.5140 -0.9853 -1.3020 K_NMOT 1.7602 0.5448 -0.5359 The shapefile for the dummy model is shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: TAZ Map with ID A mode choice model was created with utility equations for Home Based Work Trips(HBW), Home Based Other Trips(HBO), and Non Home Based Trips(NHB). A coefficient of variation is used for each input parameter to determine a range for the values that can be used within the model, to estimate the sensitivity of these parameters. The initial model was run, the change was calculated on a random selection basis, and then using latin hyoercube sampling, to see if latin hypercube sampling can estimate uncertainty in fewer runs.
