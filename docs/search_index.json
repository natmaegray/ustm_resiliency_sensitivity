This is known by transportation planners but the majority do not use any particular method to quantify it. This uncertainty exists mostly due to the variance among input parameters. A coefficient of variation can be used to approximate the standard deviation of the inputs, which then provides a range of values that are possible for model input. (Zhao and Kockelman 2002) The research questions are therefore: How many iterations of Latin Hypercube Sampling in a travel demand model are necessary to approximate random sampling methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation)?
